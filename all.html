Maharishi Atri was not in the ashram at that time. The three asked for alms to the goddess Anusiya, but also said that you have to give alms to us without getting naked. At first Anusiya was shocked to hear this, but then fearing that the sadhus should not be insulted, she remembered her husband and said that if my religion is true, then these three sadhus should become children of six months. As soon as he said this, Tridev started crying as an infant. Then Anusuiya became a mother and breastfed them with her arms and started swinging in the cradle. When the three gods did not return to their places, the ladies were distraught. Then Narada came there and told the whole thing. The three goddesses came to Anusalya and apologized.
